CapaCiti Management System
Research Report: Developing a CapaCiti Management System for Training Programs
1. Problem Definition
In many training programs, institutions face challenges managing a large number of candidates. From recruitment and onboarding to task assignments, progress tracking, and leave management, the entire process can become overwhelming without proper tools.

Key Problems:
Difficulty in tracking candidate progress and tasks.
Limited real-time insights into candidate performance for instructors or administrative personnel.
Inefficient communication and management of candidate leave and tasks.
Poor management of IT personnel involvement in tech training programs.
Lack of an integrated system for managing all aspects of the candidate life cycle (sign-up, task assignments, scorecards, etc.).
2. Scope
The scope of this research covers designing a CapaCiti Management System (CMS) tailored for educational training programs or boot camps with a technical focus.

Features:
Candidate sign-up and profile creation.
Task assignment and progress tracking.
Scorecard system to assess performance.
Leave management for both candidates and staff.
Managing staff and IT personnel involvement in the programs.
3. Target Audience
CapaCiti Program Administrators: Responsible for managing and tracking candidate progress.
Candidates: Participants in technical programs requiring task-based assessments.
IT Personnel: Supporting technical operations and overseeing task management.
4. Existing Solutions & Gaps
Learning Management Systems (LMS) - Moodle, Blackboard:
‚úÖ Focus on education delivery and assessment. ‚ùå Lack of task management and staff leave tracking.

Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS) - BambooHR, Workday:
‚úÖ Employee leave and task management. ‚ùå Not designed for education and candidate assessment.

Project Management Tools - Asana, Trello:
‚úÖ Excellent for task tracking. ‚ùå Lack educational-specific features like scorecards, profiles, and leave management.

5. Proposed Solution: CapaCiti Management System
The CMS integrates essential training program management features:

Centralized Database: Candidate profiles, staff, and IT personnel.
Task Management: Assignment and tracking.
Scorecard System: Evaluating candidate performance.
Leave Management: Handling leave requests for candidates and staff.
Sign-up & Onboarding: Streamlining enrollment.
By merging LMS, HRMS, and project management features, CMS will provide a holistic solution for technical training programs.

Frontend Architecture
The front-end will be built for an intuitive and seamless user experience.

1. Technologies Used
HTML5 & CSS3: Structuring and styling.
JavaScript (ES6): Client-side logic.
React.js: UI development.
Axios/Fetch API: Handling HTTP requests.
Bootstrap/Material UI: Responsive design.
2. User Interface
Home Page: Course overview.
Course Listings: Browse/search courses.
Course Details: Syllabus, instructors, enrollment options.
Authentication Pages: User login and registration.
Dashboard: Enrolled courses, progress tracking.
3. Key Features
User Authentication: Secure login with JWT.
Course Management: View, enroll, and track progress.
Search & Filter: Search courses by category, instructor, or keyword.
Responsive Design: Works across devices.
Interactive Components: Modals, dropdowns, forms, tooltips.
4. API Integration
Fetch course details and listings.
Manage user accounts.
Handle course enrollment and progress tracking.
5. Styling & UI
Responsive Layout: Mobile-first design.
Modern UI Components: Cards, buttons, forms, icons.
Branding: Consistent color scheme, fonts, and logo.
6. State Management (React-Based)
Redux/Context API for managing:
Authentication state
Course enrollment state
Notifications/alerts
7. Testing
Unit Testing: Jest & React Testing Library.
End-to-End Testing: Cypress/Selenium for user flow validation.
Backend Architecture
The backend is designed using Spring Boot with a microservices architecture.

1. Microservices Design
Each microservice handles a specific feature.
RESTful APIs for communication.
Each service is independently developed, tested, and deployed.
2. Key Components
API Gateway: Routes client requests, manages authentication, rate limiting, and logging.
3. Authentication & Authorization
OAuth 2.0 & JWT: Secure, stateless authentication.
Role-based Access Control: Restricts unauthorized access to services.
4. Microservice Communication
RESTful APIs: Synchronous communication.
Message Queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ): Asynchronous event-driven messaging.
5. Data Management
Database per Service: Ensures loose coupling.
Technologies: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB (depending on service needs).
Spring Data JPA/MongoDB: Manages data consistency and reliability.
6. Security Considerations
Service-to-Service Authentication: Uses client certificates, tokens, or mutual TLS.
7. Deployment & Orchestration
Containers: Packaged using Docker for simplified deployment.
Database Design
The database schema will be structured to optimize data storage and retrieval.

SQL/NoSQL solutions based on specific microservice needs.
Entity relationships for efficient data management.
üîó Database Schema Design: Lucidchart Database Design

Conclusion
The CapaCiti Management System provides educational institutions with an all-in-one solution for managing candidates, tasks, and staff efficiently. The CMS addresses existing system shortcomings, enhancing productivity and reducing administrative errors.

Future Enhancements
Real-time Dashboards: Providing instant insights.
Data Analytics: Performance trends.
Automated Reports: Instructor insights on candidate progress.
